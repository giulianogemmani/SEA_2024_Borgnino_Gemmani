**Time Distance Diagram Creator for PowerFactory**
==================================================

The Time Distance Diagram Creator (TDDC) for PowerFactory tool consists of the 
following four folders:

- calc_sw_interface (collection of the functions interfacing the TDDC logic with 
DIgSILENT PowerFactory).
- tracer (logic core of the tddc tool).
- ui (the TDDC graphical user interface python files based on the WX library).


*calc_sw_interface*
-------------------

It has been conceived as a collection of functions which allow to get and set 
the power system element parameters, run LDF/SHC calculations, and retrieve information
regarding the connection between the power system elements. 


*tdcc*
-----

The folder contains the following 4 python files:


- branch.py (definition of the Branch class which represent a list of connected 
elements modelling a feeder between two bus bars).

- Time_Distance_Diagram_Creator_PowerFactory.py (it contains the TDDC entry function).

- grid.py (file containing  the Grid class which implements the power system 
layout recognizing logic procedures).
	
- tracer_logic (it contains the main routine which calls in turn all other 
components to create the system layout, run the required SHC, collect the tripping
times, apply the setting validation rules and output the results).
