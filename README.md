## Deliverables 

### Each directory named as 'Deliverable i' (i = 1,2,3) contains a ReadMe file with a link to the respective docuement. 

### The first one is RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Docuement) which collects an overview of external word and User necessities related to the sofware proposed: it contains both requirements and specifications which are addressed for Design. The second one is DD (Design Document) which describes the strucure of the software, its modules and interactions. In the end, ID (Implementation document) gives the instrutctions necessary for the installation and other comments on the code provided. 

## DataTransfer

### This directory contains all the necessary for running our software, depending on the desired result that has to be achieved. The directory called *calc_sw_interface* is the one dedicated for transferring data from MS Excel and the other one called *picture_trasnsfer* is the one reltated to the image transferring from MATLAB/Simulink or from Power Factory. 
Each of those collects all the code which has to be run through the GUI, which is stored inside directory named _ui_. 

## Template document

### There are three template document which shall be used as examples to test the software results. They are built depending on the desired resource sw, i.e. MS Excel, MATLAB/Simulink and Power Factory respectively. 

## *matlab_runner.py*

### As explain in detail inside the documentation, this scripts aims to give an interaction between Python 3.11 and MATLAB/Simulink.
